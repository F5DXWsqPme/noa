    "Various industrial processes in geological formations, such as carbon dioxide capture sequestration, carbon-enhanced oil recovery, hydraulic fracturing, well disposal etc. could present a risk of groundwater contamination. Non-aqueous phase liquids including chlorinated hydrocarbons, oil, supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ etc. have low solubility in brine. Their migration due to external forces must be thoroughly monitored in order to avoid long-time pollution of freshwater acquifer in the subsurface. See for example:\n",
