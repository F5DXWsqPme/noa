    "Various industrial processes, such as hydraulic fracturing or $\\text{CO}_2$ sequestration in geological formations, could present a risk of groundwater contamination. Non-aqueous phase liquids including chlorinated hydrocarbons, oil, supercritical $\\text{CO}_2$ etc. have low solubility in water. Their migration due to external forces must be thoroughly monitored in order to avoid long-time pollution of drinking water in the subsurface.\n",
